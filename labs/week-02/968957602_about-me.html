            My name is Stacy Kim and I am a junior studying Systems and Information Science and minoring in 
            Information Technology, Designs and Startups. Throughout my first two years in Syracuse, I was
            very confused on what career path I wanted to talk but after switching my major and meeting people
            from the iSchool, I have developed a passion to become a UI/UX Designer.

            The organizations I am most involved with on campus include Asian Students in America (ASIA), 
            Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers (SASE), and Kappa Theta Pi (KTP). I serve as Community 
            Service Chair for both ASIA and KTP which holds the responsbility or organizing service events 
            for the general body. I am also Public Relations Chair for SASE which holds the responsbility of 
            marketing and creating content for events that our orgnization holds as well as bringing awareness
            for other organizations within the asian/professional community.
